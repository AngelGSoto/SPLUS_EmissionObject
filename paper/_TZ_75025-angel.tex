\begin{document}



In simple words HCA can be interpreted  as an algorithm that groups
similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters,
where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within
each cluster are broadly similar to each other.



Choosing the number of cluster. Firstly, the Hierarchical cluster output dendrogram (tree)
can be implemented to obtain the desired clustering. Secondly, the dendrogram schema  allows
a convenient way to establish the entity relationship between at all levels of granularity.
In conclusion, a dendrogram is a visualization in form of a tree showing the order
and distances of merges during the hierarchical clustering.
