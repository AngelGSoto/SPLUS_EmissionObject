% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

In the way to map 9000 deg$^2$ of the Southern hemisphere, the S-PLUS project is also surveying the sky in a proxy of a myriad of astrophysical processes: the H$\alpha$ transition. Here we explore such a capability from its DR3 to make H$\alpha$ emitters in evidence from 
the ($r$ - $J$0660) versus ($r$ - $i$) color-color diagram and distinguish the red from the blue ones by exploring the ($r$ - $i$) and ($g$ - $z$) diagram. Our catalog is composed of 9,200 objects that exhibit excess in the narrow $J$0660 band which is consistent with H{$\alpha$} in emission. Unsupervised, clustering machine learning approach revealed two distinct populations: one with an intense blue continuum and another with a red one. The hierarchical clustering algorithm was compared with the HDBSCAN. By adopting a ``soft'' clustering approach, we assigned the probability of each emitter belonging to a given population, blue or red clusters. We use synthetic and observed (SDSS) spectra to emphasize the potential of color-color diagrams to distinguish several classes of emission line emitters that include planetary nebulae, H II regions, young stellar objects, symbiotic stellar systems, cataclysmic variables, blue compact galaxies, star-forming galaxies, and quasars, and trace the way to reveal new ones with S-PLUS data.

\section{Introduction}

Atomic excitation followed by  recombination in Balmer hydrogen emission lines may be ignited in many different ways, as from thermal and non-thermal collisional excitation in shock-heated gas, and from energetic photons acting over a diffuse gas. As a practical result, and being Hydrogen abundant in the Universe, the observation of those electronic transitions offer an important window into the study of astrophysical objects.
Among them is H$\alpha$ ($@$6564.614\,\AA\
at vacuum, in rest-frame wavelength), 
the strongest one and therefore the Hydrogen line most widely used to identify certain systems and proceed with their investigations.

Emission line objects as the H II regions, radiated for young stars, allow us to map and study the star formation history
of the far reaches of our Galaxy and of distant galaxies. 
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) let us see remnant envelope of dying stars, illuminated by their residual white dwarf. 
Starburst galaxies and QSOs, the most luminous objects, allow us to probe the distant Universe
as for the first generation of star and the primordial formation of heavy elements. 
On the other hand, emission lines 
 trace  discs \citep{Schwope:2000, Ratti:2012} in stellar and extragalactic systems, including their geometrical characteristics from line profiles \citep{Horne:1986}.

Short-lived evolutionary stages of stars may be marked by emission lines. This category includes young stellar (YSOs) and Herbig-Haro (HH) objects surrounded by a 
nebula-like structure, evolved systems like 
post-asymptotic and some asymptotic giant branch (AGB), some
red giant stars (RGB), active late-type dwarfs, and supernova remnants. 
Amongst massive stars, emission lines are observed, for example, in Be stars when 
circumstellar decretion disks are present and in Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, which are marked by strong winds.  
Interacting binary systems experiencing mass exchange, 
%the nature of donor stars 
%\rlopes{and accreting compact objects} 
%in

%Casares:2015,Casares:2016}.
%\sout{the compact objects as black holes \citep{Casares:2016}.} 
like symbiotic stars (SySt) in which a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star accretes matter from a supergiant star, and Cataclysmic Variables (CVs), pairs of  white dwarf plus a low mass star, may be added to this category. 

Most of the classes above mentioned are not homogeneous 
and far from complete even in the local universe, with some highly populated while others less so. For example, 
there are $\sim$\,320 SySt known, with only $\sim$\,65 out of them harbored in galaxies other than the Milky Way \citep{Akras:2019a}.
%\sout{around 323 symbiotic system have been identified
%from which 257 belong to the Galaxy and  $\sim$66 are extra-galactic
%objects \citep{Akras:2019a}.} 
The number of PNe is higher, with 3500 objects listed in catalogs \citep{Parker:2016}, but it is argued that it represents only about 15-30\% of the total expected in the Galaxy (Frew, 2008; Jacoby et al., 2010).
%\sout{The same occurs with PNe from witch around
%3500 of them are been cataloged \citep{Parker:2016}, this current number
%of PNe represents only about 15-30\% of the estimated total of Galactic
%PNe (Frew, 2008; Jacoby et al., 2010) showing that a small fraction of the
%PNe have been cataloged.} 

%\rlopes{I'M HERE.}
Many H$\alpha$ surveys in a variety of angular resolution, sky coverage, and sensitivity have been carried out.
Some of them, with modest spatial resolutions, revealed 
spatially resolved, 
extended nebular emission to study supernova remnants, galaxy
groups, and star forming regions \citep[e.g.][]{1976MmRAS..81...89D}. 
Others with 
higher 
spatial resolution 
%\sout{surveys such as the INT Photometric H$\alpha$ survey
%(IPHAS; \citealt{Drew:2005, Barentsen:2014}) have focused in the study of}
disclosed compact emission line sources
in the Galaxy and sources in nearby galaxies.
%\sout{, typically with objects
%in different stage of stellar evolution}. 
Examples are the INT Photometric H$\alpha$ survey
(IPHAS; \citealt{Drew:2005, Barentsen:2014}), the  SuperCOSMOS H$\alpha$ Survey with the UK Schmidt Telescope (UKST) of the Anglo-Australian Observatory \citep{2005MNRAS.362..689P}, and the ongoing VST Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey (VPHAS+; \citealt{Drew:2014}).

Traditionally, H$\alpha$ emitters are revealed directly from images and in color-color diagrams from photometric surveys observing the sky with at most five filters. For example, the (r - H$\alpha$) versus (r - i) colour-colour diagram or similar was used
to find new 
CVs \citep{Witham:2006,Witham:2007}, 
YSOs \citep{Vink:2008}, 
SySt \citep{Corradi:2008, Corradi:2010, Corradi:2011}, 
early type emission
line stars \citep{Drew:2008}, 
and PNs \citep{Viirone:2009, Sabin:2010}. 

There are two ongoing multi-band surveys observing the sky in a systematic, complementary way with 5 broad and 7 narrow-band filters, including H$\alpha$: the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey
(J-PLUS\footnote{\url{https://www.j-plus.es}}; \citealp{Cenarro:2018}), covering the Northern celestial hemisphere, and the Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey
(S-PLUS\footnote{\url{http://www.splus.iag.usp.br}}; \citealp{Mendes:2019}), doing the same to the Southern sky with a twin 80\,cm telescope. They are paving the way for a even more ambitious survey, the Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS), which will observe the Northern sky with 56 narrow-band filters. As source revealers, the spectral energy distribution provided by these surveys also provide an unprecedented classification from photometry. However, as part of the new era of big data, efficient investigation tools are required to deal with their massive data sets and machine learning techniques have been increasingly used.

%Akras:2019}. And the same diagram in conjunction with new
%ones shows to be very efficient to find for PN candidates \citep{Gutierrez:2020}.
%In general terms, \citet{Witham:2006} presented a methodology and first results
%in looking for emission line sources in narrow-band surveys.

%\sout{The Anglo-Australian Observatory UKS

%\sout{In this era of big data on astronomy, machine learning techniques are becoming in important statistical tools for the analysis and find meaning from massive data sets.

Using unsupervised machine learning can be very advantageous because they do not require a labeled data training sets. Unlike of supervised methods like Random Forest algorithm.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:metho}

We first constructed a sub-sample from all S-PLUS iDR3 from which we
applied an iterative and automatic technique to select objects with
an excess of the H{$\alpha$} emission line. Once the objects were selected
we also make a separation of them into two groups those with red and blue
continuum by using optical colors in conjunction with unsupervised
 machine learning/statistical tools. These procedures are described below:

\subsection{Initial selection sample}
\label{sec:}

The first step in our selection procedure consists of the following
criteria to guarantee the quality of the observations of the objects:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The sources must have detection in the filters: $r$, $i$ and
  $J0660$. To assure that, we select objects that must have an error minor or
  equal to 0.2 in each of these three filters.

\item Must have magnitude in the $r$-band up to 21.
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding the main stellar locus and selecting the H{$\alpha$ emitters}}
\label{sec:find-halpha}

Once the initial cut was made, we proceed to select the objects with
an excess of H{$\alpha$} which are represented with a relatively excess magnitude-value  on
the  $J0660$-band in comparison with r-band filter. We first divided our sub-sample in four magnitude bins using the $r$-band magnitudes. The idea to split the sample into magnitude bins
consists to avoid mix faint objects, which have intrinsic high photometric uncertainties, with those sources with small photometric uncertainties in the same color-color diagram. If we combine sources with large and small errors, our selection criteria could be dominated by 
the intrinsic scatter of the faint objects. The bins have the follow distribution:

\begin{enumerate}

\item  objects with magnitude in the $r$-band $ < 16$
\item  objects with magnitude range of $16 \leq r < 18$
\item  objects with magnitude range of $18 \leq r < 20$
\item  objects with magnitude range of $20 \leq r < 21$
  
\end{enumerate}

To select the emission line objects we used a similar method created and
implemented by \citet{Witham:2008}. It is possible to do that because
 S-PLUS has similar filters to the IPHAS project, which are the
$r$, $J$0660 and $i$. This technique was used by \citet{Scaringi:2013}
to identify blue objects with H{$\alpha$} emission line.
\citet{Wevers:2017} also applied this methodology to create a catalogue
of H{$\alpha$} emission line candidates. These previous results show an high 
effectiveness of the technique. In this
order of ideas, we attempted this methodology in S-PLUS.

We first generated the ($r$ - $J0660$) versus ($r$ - $i$) color-color
diagram for each magnitude bins. We then carried a out an initial straight
line fit to all objects in each magnitude bin. This initial fit is an
attempt to find the loci of main-sequence and giant stars. We implemented
a iterative $\sigma$-clipping technique to find the best-fitting of the main
stellar locus. In this order of ideas, we made four interactive $\sigma$-clipped.
Once we have found the appropriate fitting for each magnitude bin, we identified
those objects significantly above of this final fit as likely sources with
a excess of H{$\alpha$} emission line. Objects with a significant contribution of
H{$\alpha$} should meet the condition:

\begin{equation}
  (r - J0660)_{\mathrm{obs}} - (r - J0660)_{\mathrm{fit}} \geq C \times \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mathrm{s}} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{phot}}}
  \label{eq:criterion}
\end{equation}
 
 where $\sigma_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the root mean squared value of the residuals around
 the fit and $\sigma_{\mathrm{phot}}$ is the error on the observed $(r - J0660)$ colour idex.
 $C$ is a constant which has the value 4 following \citet{Wevers:2017}.
The fits are carried out with the aid of the python library \texttt{astropy.modeling}
\footnote{https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/index.html}.

Figure~\ref{fig:criteria-color-plot} illustrates the procedure used to selected the H{$\alpha$}
emitters in S-PLUS iDR3 for each magnitude bin. The continuous black lines represent the initial
fit and  the dashed lines indicate the 4-$\sigma$ clipping fit lines. The dotted lines are
the cut selection criteria for the H{$\alpha$} emitters -- the 4-$\sigma$ above of the final
fit--. Note that theses cut lines are only an approximations because to trace them,
it is only considered the residual around the fit. The appropriate selection criteria used here
also include the phothometric uncertainties of the ($r$ - $J0660$) color for each individual data source as shows on the Equation~\ref{eq:criterion}.

    colour-colour diagrams. The thin continuous lines illustrate the original linear
    fit to all the data (grey points). The dashed lines represent the final
    fits to the stellar locus of points which were obtained by applying an iterative
    $\sigma$-clipping technique to the initial fit. The actual cuts used to select
    H{$\alpha$} emitters are shown by the dotted lines. Objects selected as H{$\alpha$}
    emitters must be located above. Note that the cut lines (selection criteria) shown
    here are only approximate, as the actual selection criterion also considers the

After the algorithm was applied to all data, we visually inspection-ed the
resulting list by seeing the S-spectra and corresponding colored image.
Figure~\ref{fig:Spectra} shows an example of how looks like the
S-spectra\footnote{S-spectra signify the S-PLUS emission in flux
or magnitude unities of an object in all twelve bands.} of the sources in
magnitude unities selected with the method explained above. This object
clearly exhibits strong H$\alpha$ emission line.

Fig~\ref{fig:emission} exhibits the distribution of the H{$\alpha$} emitters on the
($r - J0600$) versus ($r - i$) color-color plane and the the S-PLUS synthetic photometry
of the stellar locus. This stellar locus is represented by the contours in the diagram and was obtained by using the filter transmission profiles, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:curves}, and the library of stellar spectral energy distributions of \citet{Pickles:1998}. This synthetic magnitudes are defined in the AB magnitude system \citep{Oke:1983}.
At this point, we can say that
the algorithm implemented here worked well because the sources
are located  above of the loci of the main and giant stars. The wide distribution of fonts across
the ($r - J060$) and ($r - i$) colours indicates that several types of objects were selected.
For instance, higher values on the  ($r - J0660$) color of some sources could be indicating
that they are H II regions or/and blue compact galaxies and PNe. On the other hand, the 
($r$ - $i$) color indicates the  reddened nature of sources such as SySt and young stellar objects
or in the opposite case, sources with a strong blue continuum as cataclysm variables and QSOs.

Figure~\ref{fig:aitoff-distribution} displays the distribution of all emitters in Galactic latitude and longitude. The density map regions represent the spatial positions of the objects
on the sky. The surface density of $J$0660-excess objects is highest near the Galactic plane.

Once, we felt confident of our sample of H{$\alpha$} emission lines sources,
we proceeded to classify the objects into two groups; one group containing those
objects with a strong blue continuum and another formed by sources with  intense emission of the
continuum on the red part of the spectra. 

\subsection{Unsupervised machine learning/clustering techniques}
\label{sec:clustering}

In this work we used unsupervised machine learning approaches to divided our sample
into two groups: one representing the blue sources and the another the red ones.
The blue are those that have ore intense emission of the continuum on the part blue of the
spectra and the another with strong emission continuum of the red one. For that task,
was implemented two clustering techniques; hierarchical clustering and Hierarchical
density-based cluster selection based on the $(g - r)$ and $(z - g)$ colors and 
compare the results between them. 

\subsubsection{Hierarchical agglomerative clustering}
\label{sec:Hierar}

Hierarchical clustering belongs to the family of clustering algorithms
on which are constructed clusters by merging and splitting them successively.
It is an unsupervised algorithm that yields a \texttt{dendrogram}\footnote{Dendrogram is
a diagram representing tree, which shows hierarchical relationship between objects.}
represents the nested grouping based on patterns and the levels of similarity
at which the groupings change \citep{Jain:1999}. There is two type of hierarchical
clustering: one is the \textit{hierarchical agglomerative clustering} (that we have
used in this work) which is ``bottom-up'' approach. Hierarchical agglomerative
clustering (\texttt{HAC}) consists of building a binary merge tree, starting from 
each data element stored at the leaves (interpreted as individual clusters)
and proceed by merging two by two the ``closest'' sub-sets (stored at nodes)
until it reaches the root --unique cluster-- of the tree that contains all the elements
of the data set. The agglomerative term is used to define it since the individual data
point are successively agglomerated into higher-level. In each iteration, two cluster
are selected that are considered as close as possible. These clusters are merged and
replaced with a newly created merged cluster with more data points. Thus, each merging step reduces the number of cluster by a factor of``1''. Therefore, the method needs to be 
designated for measuring proximity between cluster containing multiple data points,
so that they may be merged \citep{Mann:2013, Aggarwal:2015}. We could describe how to
work the algorithm in three simple steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initially, each individual data point represents the clusters  i.e. leaves of the tree. This means that at the beginning, the number of total the clusters is the same that the number of the elements of the data set.
\item Through a looping process, the cluster or nodes are merged into groups that have the maximum similarity between them.
\item At the end of the process all the nodes belong to an unique cluster. This is
  known as the root of the tree structure.
 \end{enumerate}

The other type is the \textit{hierarchical divisive clustering}. This is a ``top-down''
approach. The data start in one cluster (the root of the tree), and splits step by step
are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy. It is the inverse procedure
of \texttt{HAC}.

In simple words, hierarchical (agglomerative and divisive) clustering approaches  
can be interpreted  as an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called 
clusters or nodes. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster 
is distinct from each other cluster,
and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.


%Starting from each label at the bottom, it is possible to see a vertical line up to a
%horizontal line. The height of that horizontal line tells you about the distance
%at which this label was merged into another label or cluster. You can find that
%other cluster by following the other vertical line down again. If you don't
%encounter another horizontal line, it was just merged with the other label
%you reach, otherwise it was merged into another cluster that was formed earlier.

%Hierarchical clustering can be performed with either a distance matrix or raw data.
%When raw data is provided, the software will automatically compute a distance
%matrix in the background. The distance matrix below shows the distance between
%six objects.

%Hierarchical clustering starts by treating each observation as a separate cluster.
%Then, it repeatedly executes the following two steps: (1) identify the two
%clusters that are closest together, and (2) merge the two most similar clusters.
%This iterative process continues until all the clusters are merged together.
%This is illustrated in the diagrams below.


\subsubsection{Hierarchical density-based cluster selection}
\label{sec:hdbscan}

Hierarchical density-based cluster selection (\texttt{HDBSCAN}, \citealp{Campello:2013})
is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm that hinges on clustering.
It is based on a slightly modified version of density-based spatial
clustering of applications with noise (\texttt{DBSCAN}; \citealp{Ester:1996}) which
declares points as noise. It is an algorithm that assumes clusters that are characterized
by ``islands'' of high density in the sea of the parameter space, such
clusters are regarded as data partitions that have a higher density
than their surroundings \citep{Ntwaetsile:2021}. \texttt{HDBSCAN} takes forward the
DBSCAN concept by introducing a hierarchy to the clustering, with ``persistent''
clusters finally extracted from the hierarchical tree. The main advantage of
HDBSCAN in comparison with the predecessor consists in the possibility in finding
clusters of variables densities and different shape. Following \citet{Malzer:2021}
and \citet{Ntwaetsile:2021} works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In \texttt{HDBSCAN} is consider the ``core'' distance for a point $x$, core$_k(x)$,
  which defines the distance of an object to the $k$th nearest neighbor. It is an
  efficient way of measurement of density. This mean that low values of core$_k(x)$ 
  represents high density and vice-versa.

\item The ``mutual readability distance'' between two points $a$ and $b$ is defined as
  $d_{\mathrm{m}}(a, b) = \mathrm{min}{\mathrm\{core}_k(a), \mathrm{core}_k(b), d(a, b)\}$,
  where $d(a, b)$ is the distance between $a$ and $b$ according, for instance,
  Euclidean metric. The mutual readability distance allows points in dense regions
  to stay close together and those that are in less dense regions pushed away.

\item The mutual readability graph is used to construct the minimum spanning tree,
  and sorting its edges by the mutual readability distance resulting in a
  hierarchical tree structure. The hierarchy of connected components is
  defined by sorting the edges of the tree by distance in reverse order,
  describing a dendrogram. This is the structure from which the cluster will
  be identified.

\item \texttt{HDBSCAN} allows to extract clusters of variable density, effectively,
  by cutting the dendrogram at different points.

\item The cluster tree is condensed into a simpler structure (see, for instance, Figure~\ref{fig:condensed-trees} of appendices~\ref{sec:trees}). 
Considering the single main trunk which contains all the data points, the tree splits into branches.
  A condensed cluster hierarchy can be described by considering the number points
  kept in each branch as it splits. If a given branch divides into two, with a branch
  containing fewer points than the minimum cluster size means, the large branch
  ``persists'' and the smaller split branch ``falls out'' of the  cluster. If
  a branch splits into two with both branches exceeding the minimum cluster size,
  both new branches are conserved.

\item The clusters are extracted on the notion of persistence in the hierarchy.
  The parameter $\lambda = d_{\mathrm{m}}^{-1}$ is defined, and each cluster has a
  $\lambda_{\mathrm{birth}}$ (the point at which the cluster split off) and
  $\lambda_{\mathrm{death}}$ (the point when the cluster split into other clusters).
  In each cluster, we have $\lambda_p$ describing when each point fell out of the
  cluster (or was split off into new cluster), $\lambda_{\mathrm{birth}} \leq \lambda_{p} \leq \lambda_{\mathrm{death}}$.
  Cluster stability  $S$ is defined as the sum of $\lambda_{p} - \lambda_{\mathrm{birth}}$
  for all points in the cluster. To extract cluster the following procedure is
  implemented: First, select all leaves as cluster. Then, working through the
  hierarchy, consider the stability of a parent cluster $S_p$ and its $n$ descendants
  $S_d^{0,1,2,...,n}$. If $S_p > \sum_{i=0}^{n} S_d^i$ we unselect all the descendants.
  If $S_p < \sum_{i=0}^{n} S_d^i$ then the cluster stability is set such that
  $S_p = \sum_{i=0}^{n} S_d^i$. At the root node we have our set of selected 
  cluster. Any point in the sample that does not fall into one of the selected
  clusters is defined as noise.

\item The selected cluster are used to the label points. Furthermore, the definition
  of $\lambda_p$ within a cluster, when normalized between O and 1 provides a means
  of characterization a probability that a given point belongs to the cluster or
  alternative a measure of the strength of membership. 
  
\end{enumerate}

The algorithm starts off much the same as {\sc DBSCAN}: transforming the space
according to density, exactly as DBSCAN does, and perform single linkage
clustering on the transformed space. Instead of taking an epsilon\footnote{Epsilon parameter in {\sc DBSCAN} represents the maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other. This is the most important DBSCAN parameter to choose appropriately for the data set and distance function.} value
as a cut level for the dendrogram however, a different approach is taken:
the dendrogram is condensed by viewing splits that result in a small number
of points splitting off as points ``falling out of a cluster''. This results
in a smaller tree with fewer clusters that ``lose points''. That tree can then
be used to select the most stable or persistent clusters. This process allows
the tree to be cut at varying height, picking our varying density clusters
based on cluster stability. The immediate advantage of this is that we can
have varying density clusters; the second benefit is that we have eliminated
the epsilon parameter as we no longer need it to choose a cut of the dendrogram.
Instead we have a new parameter \texttt{min\_cluster\_size} which is used
to determine whether points are ``falling out of a cluster'' or splitting
to form two new clusters. 
%This trades an unintuitive parameter for one that
%is not so hard to choose for EDA (what is the minimum size cluster I am
%willing to care about?).


%Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (Campello,
%Moulavi, and Sander 2013), (Campello et al. 2015). Performs \texttt{DBSCAN} overvarying
%epsilon values and integrates the result to find a clustering that gives the best
%stability over epsilon. 
%This allows \texttt{HDBSCAN} to find clusters of varying densities
%(unlike \texttt{DBSCAN}), and be more robust to parameter selection. The library also
%includes support for Robust Single Linkage clustering (Chaudhuri et al. 2014),
%(Chaudhuri and Dasgupta2010), GLOSH outlier detection (Campello et al. 2015), and
%tools for visualizing and exploring cluster structures. Finally support for prediction
%and soft clustering is also available.

In the last years, \texttt{HDBSCAN} have been in astronomy for different tasks.
\citet{Jayasinghe:2019} presented the second data release Milky Way Project (MWP), a citizen
science initiative on the Zooniverse platform, presents internet users with infrared (IR)
images from Spitzer on which were aggregate $\sim$3 million classifications made
by volunteers during the years 2012-2017 to produce the DR2 catalogue, which
contains 2600 IR bubbles and 599 candidate bow shock driving stars.
The reliability of bubble identifications was made by using \texttt{HDBSCAN}.
On the other hand, \citet{Webb:2020} used \texttt{HDBSCAN} for transient discovery.
Recently, \citet{Ntwaetsile:2021} used it to group radio sources into a sequence
of morphological classes, illustrating a simple methodology to classify and
label new, unseen galaxies in large samples. This approach was also implemented to identify stellar groups in Canis Major OB1 \citep{Santos-Silva:2021}.

\subsection{Grouping the H{$\alpha$} emitters into blue and red colour-types}
\label{sec:apply-hac-hdbscan}

Given that $(g - r)$ and $(z - g)$ colours are the input data to implement the machine learning approaches, we first will speak about them.

\subsubsection{$(g - r)$ versus $(z - g)$ color-color diagram}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figs/Fig-SPLUS-gr-zg.pdf}
        \caption{The $(g - r)$ versus $(z - g)$ synthetic color-color diagram of
          several classes of emission lines objects. Included in the diagrams, there
          are families of CLOUDY modelled halo PNe spanning a range of properties (density
          map region). Cyan circles represent S-PLUS photometry from observed spectra
          Grey diamonds represent H II regions in NGC 55. Red
          boxes display symbiotic stars, this group also includes Galactic and
          external SySt from NGC 205 IC 10 and NGC 185,. Yellow circles correspond to
          cataclysmic variables (CVs) from SDSS. Pink circles indicate  blue compact
          galaxies (BCGs) from SDSS. Orange triangles refer to SDSS
          star-forming galaxies (SDSS SFGs). SDSS QSOs at different redshift
          ranges are shown as light blue diamonds, and YSOs from Lupus and
          Sigma Orionis are represented by salmon stars. The diagonal dashed line represents
         a subjective criterion to separate the objects into two color types.  The arrow
         indicates the reddening vector with AV $\simeq$ 2 mag. {\sc Maybe 
         is a good idea to put the reddened vector of this color-color diagram.}}
    \label{fig:synthetic}
\end{figure}

In order to find the best color-color diagram to separating the final sample of
emission line objects into two colour-types, we first attempted constructed  color-color
diagrams by using the S-PLUS synthetic photometry of several classes of emission line
objects\footnote{It is important to note that there are other classes of objects
with emission lines that have not been included. Our main objective is to explore different populations and/or types of these objects by using their photometric colors.}.
The $(g - r)$ versus $(z - g)$ color-color diagram is displayed on
the Fig.~\ref{fig:synthetic}. The SySt span a wide range on the $(z - g)$ color,
  from approximately -0.5 to 6.0. This wide range on the color may refer to the different
  type spectral of the cold stellar component of the binary system. All the YSOs and many
  SySt are located on the top-left on the diagram indicating a reddening effect of the
  circumstellar disk for many SySt (for example for those symbiotic with a Mira star)
  and YSOs. On the other hand, the PNe, HII regions, CVs, QSOs and emission line galaxies
  are located on the lower-right region of the diagram. This indicates blue continuum
  present in each classes of theses objects, mainly by the presence of the high excitation
  star, for instance, white dwarf in planetary nebulae and cataclysm variable stars and
  massive young stars in H II regions and starburst galaxies. Although some SySt are located
  in the region where appear the blue sources, this color-color diagram seems to separate
  very well two color types, blue from red sources. The dashed line is an attempt to limit
   both regions, the blue and red zone.
  
  \begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figs/red-blue-colorObjects-gr-edit.jpg}
        \caption{The $(g - r)$ versus $(z - g)$ color-color diagram with all the emission line
        objects selected in S-PLUS. The inset figures represent the $(g - r)$ and  $(z - g)$
        colour distributions.}
    \label{fig:new-color}
\end{figure}


We constructed the $(g - r)$ versus $(z - g)$ color-color diagram using 
our final list of H{$\alpha$} emitters, which is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:new-color}.
As was we expected two-color population is showed in the diagram perceptible in the level of the
color of the density region on which yellow areas represent a higher concentration of points.
This is re-forced by the bi-modal shape of the $(g - r)$ and $(z - g)$ color distributions (see inset plots of the Fig.~\ref{fig:new-color}). The two peaks of the $(g - r)$ and $(z - g)$
distributions clearly correspond to blue and red sources, respectively. This histograms also
show that the fraction of blue objects is considerable higher than the red ones.

\subsubsection{\texttt{HAC}}

The ideal way to choose the number of clusters can be done by displaying the \textbf{dendrogram diagram}. Firstly, the hierarchical cluster output dendrogram (tree; see for instance Figure~\ref{fig:condensed-trees}) can be implemented to obtain the desired clustering. Secondly, the dendrogram schema allows 
a convenient way to establish the entity-relationship between at all levels of granularity.
In conclusion, a dendrogram is a visualization in form of a tree showing the order
and distances of merges during the hierarchical clustering:

\begin{itemize}
  
     \item The $x$-axis specifies the labels. If it does not specify anything else, they
           are the indices of the samples. This means, the number of points in nodes/clusters.
     \item The $y$-axis represents the distances of the ``ward'' method. In other words,
           this axis is a measurement of the closeness of the clusters or data points.
       
\end{itemize}

We first generated the dendrogram diagram to see the possibles clusters that can be found with
\texttt{HAC}. The dendrogram diagram sometimes can be pretty big for many samples, 
especially in the
context of the big data and the visualization of the cluster can be difficult. However, the \textsc{dendrogram()} function, which is 
include in the python package \texttt{scipy}\footnote{https://www.scipy.org/}, allow us to generate this diagram, and has a feature to allow a better visualization of them. 
This is the \textit{Dendrogram Truncation}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:dendrogram} exhibits the truncated dendrogram plot based on the colours
parameters. This only shows the last 12 nodes out of all merges. Note that most labels are not showing. This is because all other data were already merged into clusters before the last 12 merges. From the diagram is perceptive that the longest distances correspond to 
the two last merged that are the two clusters that we desire to produce with 
the hierarchical clustering algorithm.

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figs/Customer-Dendrograms.pdf}
    \caption{Truncated dendrogram of complete-linkage hierarchical clustered based on $(g - r)$ and $(z - g)$ colours. The cluster sizes are exposed in the brackets for the 12 truncated clusters.}
    \label{fig:dendrogram}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Figs/blued-red-hierarchical.pdf}
    \caption{The $(g - r)$ versus $(z - g)$ color-color diagram with the two population
    found by implementing \texttt{HAC} algorithm. The blue and red symbols represent the sources with intense blue continuum and those with intense red continuum, respectively. The straight line is the same line of Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic}.}
    \label{fig:hierar}
\end{figure}

In this work, we implemented {\sc hac} by using the python machine learning library
\texttt{Scikit-learn}\footnote{\url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}} \citep{Pedregosa:2011}.
There are some parameters to have in count
when the algorithm is applied: \texttt{n\_clusters} which is the number cluster to find. Given
that our goal is to divide our sample in two groups we set this value in "2". \texttt{Affinity} the is the "metric" used to compute the linkage. We found that a simple ``Euclidean'' distance metric is
effective. \texttt{Linkage} which determines which distance to use between sets of observation.
The algorithm merge the pairs of cluster that minimize this criterion. Here was implemented
``ward'' which minimizes the variance of the clusters being merged. As was mentioned,
the input variables are the colors; ($g - r$) and ($z - g$).

Figure.~\ref{fig:dendrogram} shows the dendrogram truncated diagram visualization that
shows the branching of the sample from the main root. And Fig.~\ref{fig:hierar} shows
the position of the two groups that resulted after to applying \texttt{HAC} in the
color-color diagram. The two clusters represent the blue sources (blue simbols)
and red sources (blue symbols) as already by analyzing the diagram of the
Fig.~\ref{fig:synthetic}. Now, we have divided our list in two groups in agreement
with the nature of their continuum. We found that the number of blue H{$\alpha$}
emitter is bigger than the red one.

\subsubsection{\texttt{HDBSCAN}}

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth, trim=10 10 5 8, clip]{Figs/blued-red-hdbscan.pdf}

  \end{tabular}  
  \caption{As Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic} but with the results after to apply \texttt{HDBSCAN} (\textit{left panel}) to the sample of H{$\alpha$}. The blue and red symbols correspond to blue and red sources, respectively. Gray symbols are the sources classified as noise by \texttt{HDBSCAN}. And the results after apply a soft clustering to the \texttt{HDBSCAN} results (\textit{right panel}). The straight line is the same line as Figure~\ref{fig:synthetic}.}
\label{fig:hdbscan}
\end{figure*}

We also used \texttt{HDBSCAN} to separate the blue sources from the red ones. This is just for
comparing the performance of two algorithms and show that the our results are consistent.
We used the python implementation of \texttt{HDBSCAN}\footnote{\url{https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}}
\citep{McInnes:2017}. Like \texttt{HAC}, in addition to the colors input
parameters,  there are key parameters that should be considered  when the algorithm is
applied. ``Euclidean'' metric is implemented which results to be very efficient. The two most
critical parameters to be implemented are the ``minimum cluster size'' and ``minimum number
of samples''. The former refers to the smallest size grouping that we wish to consider a cluster.
We have adopted the value ``80''. The latter provides a measure of how conservative we want our
clustering to be and expressed as the fraction of data classified as noise.
The value implemented was ``40''. With this configuration of our model we found
two cluster. If we use values of minimum number of samples smaller than ``40'' 
several small cluster are found that do not make sense.

Left panel of Fig~\ref{fig:hdbscan} the resulted cluster found with \texttt{HDBSCAN}. Two group are
found and these results are consistent with results found with  \texttt{HAC}.
In fact, by applying the
\texttt{condensed\_tree\_} to the data colors two clusters are selected (for mare detail about
\texttt{condensed\_tree\_} attribute see appendix~\ref{sec:trees} and related
Fig.~\ref{fig:treess}). The two primary clusters are located in the same region in
the ($g - r$) versus ($z - g$) color-color diagram where lie the group found by the other algorithm.
The main difference between the two algorithm is that  \texttt{HDBSCAN}
is much conservative, then many data points are classified as noise. The two final cluster
contain, which we are labeled blue and red sources contain xxx and xxx objects, respectively.

\subsubsection{Soft clustering for \texttt{HDBSCAN}}

Perhaps, the main disadvantage of \texttt{HDBSCAN} is that many of the sources are labelled
as ``noise''. This means that some sources are not assigned to any cluster. As was mentioned,
this comes from the conservative nature of \texttt{HDBSCAN}
and the fact that these data sources are located far away of the cluster cores.
An alternative to avoid the outliers (noises) classification consists in used the concept 
of ``soft clustering''. We have carried out here soft
clustering for \texttt{HDBSCAN} to assign every object to its most likely cluster on which belong.
This means that with this approach, points are not assigned cluster labels, instead are
assigned a vector of probabilities. The probability value at the $i$th entry of the vector
is the probability that a data point is a member of the $i$th cluster. We can, then, simply
assign cluster labels for every point by taking the most likely cluster it belongs to,
using probability thresholds. Soft clustering for \texttt{HDBSCAN} is based on the
Global-Local Outlier Score from Hierarchies (GLOSH) algorithm \citep{Campello:2015}
and combines this with a measure of distance from a given cluster to produce 
an estimate of the probability that any given data point belongs to any of the fixed 
clusters extracted from the condensed tree.

The right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:hdbscan} shows at what most likely cluster belongs the data
points classified as the noise by \texttt{HDBSCAN}. We have used blue and red colors for the
points that have the highest probability of being in the blue and red groups, respectively.
This fills out the clusters nicely. We see that there were many noise points that are most
likely to belong to the clusters we would expect, e. g. in agreement we the results obtained
with \texttt{HAC}. Indeed, We now have improved our classification of our list into sources
with blue and red continuum because we have estimated the probability of each source to belong
to every group.

\section{Results and discussion}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Matches with other databases}
\label{sec:matches}
We found a total of 389 emission line sources in all S-PLUS DR3.
To understand the nature of the objects  and the fractional
contribution of different classes of objects with emission lines to the overall sample cross-matching with some catalogs available were carried out.

We made cross-match between our sample of objects with excesses of emission on
the $J$0660 filter and SIMBAD database. We searched for all objects using a radius of 2 arcsec
around the position of the optical source in question. We found 1000
matches that include a great variety of emission line objects. In table
\ref{tab:simbad-sources} is showed the different categories of objects found
with SIMBAD coincidence.

  \label{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects2}
\end{figure*}

As was mentioned, objects with nebulosity are include several
types of objects such as H II region, planetary nebulae or, supernova
remnants (SNRs). Such sources in our Galaxy and other nearby galaxies were
identified here. The H II regions are objects with gas that being ionized by
amounts of UV light come from massive stars (OB type) on which
are formed the emission lines. In theses clouds of ionized gas,
new stars are formed. Unlike H II regions, planetary nebulae
represent the final stages of low- and intermediate-mass stars
where the gas previously ejected in the phase of AGB is ionized
by the high energetic radiation come from their central stars.

In our list of H{$\alpha$} emission line objects a PN appears cataloged in SIMBAD 
on which the S-PLUS photometry and spectrum is displyed on panel (\textit{a}) 
of Fig~\ref{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects}. Emission lines like H{$\alpha$} 
and [N II] are clearly perceptive in its spectrum, agreeing with PLUS photometry.
This objects is a very interesting because is one of the twelves PNe that belong
to the Galactic halo. These PNe are low metallizite and present large velocities that
can give count of the origin and nuclesintheis of the early universe. 30 objects 
cataloged as HII regions on the SIMBAD database are in our list of H{$\alpha$} emitters. 
Panel (\textit{b}) oh the figure shows the S-PLUS photometry and SDSS spectrum 
of the extragalactic HII region GALEX 2417063145906373262.  

Supernova and nova are other type of emission lie objects on which shell of gas arise from
evolved stars. The physical nature on the gas of them is different to the typical gaseous 
nebulae (H II regions and planetary nebulae). The general energy-input mechanism is quiet different in each case. 
However, the emission-line spectra show general similarities, indicating that when the 
ionized gas is heating tends 
to produce the same emission-line photons, regardless of the mechanisms by which high temperature and ionization are produced. 
In agreement with SIMBAD coincidences, supernovas and novas are 
in our list as show table~\ref{tab:simbad-sources}. Panel \textit{d} of
Figure~\ref{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects} exhibits the SDSS spectrum, S-PLUS photometry 
and coloured image of an extragalatic SN. The emission lines are clearly perceptively in its spectrum. 

\paragraph{Binary systems.}
25 known CVs and 5 candidate CVs (from SIMBAD) were selected with the algorithm.
CVs are binary systems of very short orbital period, in which a low-mass and
early-type star fills its Roche region and transfers mass to a companion stars,
a dwarf white \citep{Patterson:1984}. Fig.~\ref{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects} the S-PLUS
photometry overlapped to the SDSS spectrum of the CV FASTT 1560. As expected,
this object was classified as blue source by the machine learning approaches.
Other binary system in our list are the X-binary sources and eclipsing binary. 
That type of object is expected to be in our sample because majority of them 
are known to be H{$\alpha$} emitters.

\paragraph{Stars.}
Several stars were selected as shows the  SIMBAD matches.
The SIMBAD types include normal stars, white dwarf stars (WD*), white dwarf
candidates (Candidate\_WD*), blue stars, blue super-giant stars (BlueSG*), high
proper-motion stars (PM*) and low-mass star (low-mass*; M<1M$_\odot$). All these
objects appears in the S-PLUS catalog as H{$\alpha$} emitters. Some of them 
can be early/late-type emission-line stars and/or different types of stars with
the H{$\alpha$} emission lines. Although some of these stars could represent the 
fraction of contaminants of our sample. There are also matches to variable
stars of RR Lyr type as well as candidates of them.

\paragraph{Galaxies.}
Emission line galaxies also were selected. This category include
several class of galaxies according to SIMBAD types: emission-line galaxy (EmG),
blue compact galaxy (BlueCompG), HII galaxy (HII G), galaxy in cluster of galaxies
(GinCl), galaxy in group of galaxies (GinGroup), low surface brightness galaxy
(LSB G), interacting galaxies (IG), part of a Galaxy (PartofG), Seyfert 1 and
Seyfert 2 galaxies, AGN and galaxy.

All the emission line galaxies of these category form part of the universe local.
This mean that their reds-hift cover the range on which the H{$\alpha$} emission line still
falls into the $J0660$ filter. Objects with $ z >  0.02$ the  H{$\alpha$} is outside 
of the $J0660$ filter. Table~\ref{tab:simbad} of the appendices shows the red-shift of the
emission line galaxies of our sample that have SIMBAD matches. Many of the galaxies have 
small red-shift values probing that mostly of these galaxies are real H{$\alpha$} emitters. 
In these kind of galaxies such as the blue 
compact and/or H II galaxies their starburst regions that consist of ensemble of massive 
ionizing stars and their respective giant H II regions cover the extension of the optical 
images and the emission lines of their spectra. Fig.~\ref{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects2}
shows the SDSS spectra and S-PLUS photometry of the H II galaxy 6dFGS gJ012646.5-003845 
(panel \textit{a}) and of the radio galaxy NVSS J025557+004132 (panel \textit{b}). The H II galaxy is classified 
as blue source while the radio galaxy as red by the machine learning algorithm which is obvious from their spectra. 

On the other hand, several AGN, Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies have red-shift 
between 0.31 and 0.37 indicating that the excess on the $J0660$ filter
is not due to the H{$\alpha$} emission but if due to the H{$\beta$} and [O III] 4959, 5007 \AA~ 
emission lines. These emission lines at the red-shift range $0.306 < z < 0.376$ are detected in the $J0660$ band. 
It is well known that the AGNs have very strong emission 
lines such as H{$\beta$}, [0 III] 4959, 5007 \AA~and H{$\alpha$}. 

One interesting discussion here, is that the type part of a Galaxy (PartofG)
on SIMBAD are actually galaxies with Wolf-Rayet (WR) signature in the low red shift
universe also named ``WR galaxy'' \citep{Osterbrock:1982}. WR stars in galaxies
is perceptible in their spectra with strong emission lines such as H{$\alpha$}
and [NII]. These spectral features can be of them very similar to extragalactic
H II regions present typically of the outskirt of spiral galaxies. Panel (\textit{e}) 
of Fig.~\ref{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects} displays the S-PLUS and SDSS spectra 
of the  Wolf-Rayet [BKD2008] WR 14 which belong to the galaxy ??.

Many of the objects have as main type ``galaxy'' in SIMBAD. This galaxies
could be spiral galaxies on which the star formation is present. It is known
that in the spiral arms of the galaxies are present H II regions as well as
neutral gas (H I) and molecular gas. Actually some of these galaxies haves for
secondary type H I. The reservoir of H I gas in galaxies must ultimately
feed their star formation, after cooling and forming molecular
clouds \citep{van-Driel:2016}. Fig. shows the S-PLUS photometry and
the SDSS spectra of star-forming galaxy with clearly strong emission lines.
Note that almost all these galaxies are classified as blue color 
type objects by the \texttt{HAC} and \texttt{HDBSCAN}.
However, Mostly of the Seyfert 2 and radio galaxies and a handful of galaxies are classified as
red sources. The objects with galaxies in SIMBAD could that belong to the red sub-sample are nearby, red, giant early-type galaxies with emission lines, mainly, they could be LINERS, AGB or radio galaxies \citep{Capetti:2011}.

\paragraph{QSOs.}

Other extragalactic objects with emission lines that were selected are the
QSOs. In the case of the QSOs is not the H{$\alpha$} emission line who impact
on the $J$0660 filter. This filter is affected by strong emission lines present in
these objects that to specific redshift drop into the $J$0660 filter.
Some of these emission lines are H{$\beta$}, C {\sc IV} 1550 \AA, C {\sc III]} 1909 \AA,
  Mg {\sc II} 2798 \AA~(see, also \citealp{Gutierrez:2020, Nakazono:2021}).
  All the objects were classified as blue sources which was the expected. Panel \textit{f} of
  Figure~\ref{fig:photo-image-knonw-objects2} show the S-PLUS photomerty and SDSS spectrum of the QSO 2SLAQ J220529.34-003110.6
  which has red-shift of $\sim$2.45 indicating that the emission line corresponds to
  the line C {\sc III]}.
  
\paragraph{Other type of objects.}
  
  Miscellanies the objects were selected as H{$\alpha$} emitters that appear classified on
  SIMBAD as it can see in the table~\ref{tab:simbad-sources}. They are included cluster of stars, FIR sources, MIR objects, molecular clouds, UV-emission source,  among other

\subsubsection{SDSS and LAMOST}

We also made cross-match between the sample of H{$\alpha$} emission line objects and SDSS DR16
\citep{Ahumada:2020}. We have used a 2$\sigma$ error circle as the cross-matching radius.
We got 200 spectra from which 195 objects exhibit strong emission lines. 5 objects do not show
emission lines, they probably are stars or galaxies.

We also cross-correlate our list with Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST; \citealp{Wu:2011}) using a radius of 2 arcsec for the match.  These spectra also
show strong emission lines. These results shows that this technique actually are very effective
for selecting sources with strong emission lines.

By These spectra correspond to HII regions, cataclysm variables, SN, emission line galaxies (blue compact galaxies, H II galaxies, star forming galaxies, among others), AGN (Seyfert 1 and 2), 
and QSOs. However, more detailed analyzed are necessary to see that other possibles type 
of objects are included in these samples of spectra.

\subsection{Magnitudes and color distributions}

  \caption{Distribution of $r$ magnitude  (left panel), $(r - i)$ color (middle panel), and $(r - J0660)$
    color (right panel) for the blue and red sources of the sample of H$\alpha$ emitters.
    Both sample are normalized to their maximum counts, xx and xx objects for blue and
    red sources, respectively. The smooth curves represent a Kernel density estimation for both samples.}
    \label{fig:diagram-distri}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:diagram-distri} shows the magnitude and color distribution of the blue and red
sources --classification performed with machine learning on Section~\ref{sec:clustering}--.
Upper panel of the figure shows the distribution of the blue and red sources of the $r$ magnitude.
The peaks of the $r$ distribution is the same for the blue and red sources, which is around
$r \sim 19.9$. However, the density at the peak is higher in red sources than the blue ones
indicating that the proportion of objects with value $r$ of 19.9 is higher than the blue sources.
The fraction of object is very small at $r < 16$ for each group of objects.
The distribution of the objects for both group increase in the range $16 \gtrsim r \gtrsim 19.9$.
However, the density as indicating the Kernel density estimation curves is higher in the
blue sources. This implies that the fraction of sources with the magnitude range is considerable higher
in comparison with the red group. In conclusion the blue sources tends to be brighter than the red ones.

Middle panel of figure displays the $(r - i)$ distribution of the blue and red emission line
objects. The peaks of the $(r - i)$ distributions are distinct for the blue and red sources.
The peaks of the red sources at high red continuum,  $(r - i) = 0.5$, compared to the value
of the blue sample, $(r - i) = -0.9$. All these results are consistent because the $(r - i)$
color is an indicating of reddened sources. This is also consistent with previous works. 
For instance, \citet{Wevers:2017} used different algorithms based on the  $(r - i)$ color
to successfully select blue outliers from the the Galactic Bulge Survey (GBS; \citealp{Jonker:2011}).

Botton panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:diagram-distri} shows the
$(r - J0660)$ color distribution of the blue and red objects. The fraction of objects selected
as emitter rises drastically with $J$0660 excess, until at sufficiently large excesses. The peaks of the $(r - J0660)$ color distribution are relatively different for both groups 
of sources. Having the blue sources the peaks at  $(r - J0660) = 0.5$ while for the red 
ones the value peak is $(r - J0660)=0.7$.


\section{Conclusions}

We have created an usefully and important sample of emission line objects.
By identifying the locus of main-sequence and giant star on the ($r - J0660$) versus ($r - i$) colour-colour diagram and considering objects 
with H$\alpha$-excess, those located above of this locus. The sample contains 9,000 sources
that were identify as H{$\alpha$} emitters.
In agreement with the SIMBAD coincidences several classes of emission line objects are
in our list, including nebulae, binary systems, variable stars, x-ray sources, emission line galaxies, quasars, globular clusters among other.   \\
La gran ventaja aqui en comparación con trabajos previos, es que nosotros estamos proporcionando
una muestra importante de emisores de H$\alpha$ en 12 bandas. 7 filtros estrechos y 5 de banda ancha, cubriendo el rango
en longitud de onda desde $\sim 3000$ hasta $\sim 9000$ \AA. Es decir que mucha más información se puede estraer 
de ellos en futors trabjaos sólo con fotometría de S-PLUS.

We found that the $g - r$ versus $(z - g)$ color-color diagram works well in separating
the blue sources from the red ones. \\

We also found that using this colors as the input parameters to implement unsupervised machine 
learning is better to group or classify sources in color types.

\label{sec:trees}

The condensed Trees is a diagram for \texttt{HDBSCAN} that allows to see the cluster hierarchy as a dendrogram.  It can be displayed via the \texttt{condensed\_tree\_}
attribute of the \texttt{HDBSCAN} package. Figure~\ref{fig:condensed-trees} shows
the condensed trees which was obtained by using the ($r - g$) and ($g - z$) colours as the
the input parameters. It is possible to see that \texttt{HDBSCAN} has found
two clusters in agreement with previous results. This means that they represent the blue and red sources.
