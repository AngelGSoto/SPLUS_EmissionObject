  The emission line objects are very important objects in astronomy
  because reflects different class of objects that evolved physical
  mechanics that given counts of formation stellar process, presences
  the gas, shocks, star-burst in galaxies, the finals stage of stars
  among others process. For this reason we have created a list of
  H{$\alpha$} emitters selected from the S-PLUS data, which is mapping
  the southern hemisphere at relatively high latitudes. We implemented
  the (r - $J$0660) versus (r - i) color-color diagram for that task.
  We found 9,200 objects that exhibit um excess in emission in the J066o
  which we have traduced as the presence of the H{$\alpha$} emission line.
  In addition we have found that by combining the colors: (r - i) and (g - z)
  with unsupervised (clustering) machine learning it is possible separate
  the blue sources from red ones, then we ave divided our list of emitters
  in two sub-groups: one with intense blue continuum and another with
  intense red one. We compare hierarchical-clustering algorithm with the
  HDBSCAN. By adopting a ``soft'' clustering approach, we can assign
  each emission object a probability of belonging to a given cluster
  (blue or red group), allowing for more flexibility in the classification
  of objects according to these colours those objects with a low probability
  of belonging to any cluster.

\section{Introduction}

The existence of an ionizing radiation field can lead to Balmer hydrogen
emission lines. From the presence  of the H Balmer lines in the optical
spectra of some sources it is well known the possible presence of ionized
gas. Many important astronomical objects involve the physics of photo-ionized
gases and the interpretation of the emission-line spectra. Emission line
objects as the H II regions allow us to study the star formation history
of the far reaches of our Galaxy and of distant galaxies. Planetary nebulae
let us to see the remaining envelope of dying stars. Star-burst galaxies and
QSOs are one the most luminous objects and hence the most distant that can
be observed. Their spectra can reveal details about of the first generation
of star and the formation of heavy elements in the young universe. On the
other hand, emission lines can also infer the presence or lack the accretion
discs \citep{Schwope:2000, Ratti:2012}, the properties of single or double
picked line can allow us to infer geometrical characteristics \citep{Horne:1986},
the nature of  donor stars in binary system \citep{Steeghs:2002, Spaandonk:2010, Casares:2015}
and the compact objects as black holes \citep{Casares:2016}. 

Emission lines are also associated with stars in very early-type and/or
very late evolutionary stage which are short phase. As already mentioned
are also associated with binaries that experiencing mass transfer. These
group of emission line stars includes young stellar (YSOs) and Herbig-Haro
(HH) objects, post-asymptotic and some asymptotic giant branch (AGB), some
red giant stars (RGB), Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, supernova remnants, classical
Be stars, active late-type dwarfs, interacting binary system like symbiotic
stars (SySt) and cataclysmic variables (CV). Most of these class of object
are in-homogeneous and some contains many few identified members, for
instance at the moment around 323 symbiotic system have been identified
from which 257 belong to the Galaxy and  $\sim$66 are extra-galactic
objects \citep{Akras:2019a}. The same occurs with PNe from witch around
3500 of them are been cataloged \citep{Parker:2016}, this current number
of PNe represents only about 15-30\% of the estimated total of Galactic
PNe (Frew, 2008; Jacoby et al., 2010) showing that a small fraction of the
PNe have been cataloged. Many galaxies, in addition to harbor Planetary
nebulae and H II regions, show characteristic nebular in their spectra.
In most of these objects, the gas is photoionized by hot stars in the nucleus,
which is thus much like giant H II region, or perhaps many H II regions.
The galactic nucleus with very strongest  emission lines of this type are
often called blue compact galaxies, extragaltic H II regions, star forming
or starburst galaxies \citep{Osterbrock:2006}. There are also spiral galaxies
that present emission lines.

In the past H$\lpha$ surveys with modest spatial resolutions have been used
to identified extended nebular emission to study supernova remnants, galaxy
groups and star forming regions (Davies, Elliott & Meaburn 1976). More recently,
higher resolution surveys such as the INT Photometric H$\alpha$ survey
(IPHAS; \citealt{Drew:2005, Barentsen:2014}) have focused in the study of
compact emission line sources on the Galactic plane, typically with objects
in different stage of stellar evolution. The Anglo-Australian Observatory UKS
chmidt Telescope Supercosmos H$\alpha$ Survey (Parker et al. 2005) is another
H{$\alpha$} survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Magellanic Cloud which
has covered to b $\sim$ 10-13$^{\circ}$ (verificar esto). Currently ongoing is
the VST Photometric H$\alpha$ Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Bulge
(VPHAS+; \citealt{Drew:2014}) that will cover the Galactic bulge and plane in
five filters. 

Like VPHAS+, others ongoing surveys that are used to study the population of
emission line objects are the The Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey
(J-PLUS\footnote{\url{https://www.j-plus.es}}, \citealp{Cenarro:2018})
and the Southern-Photometric Local Universe Survey
(S-PLUS\footnote{\url{http://www.splus.iag.usp.br}}, \citealp{Mendes:2019})
are providing observations of the Galactic halo covering both northern and
southern celestial hemispheres in a systematic way with twin telescopes
using the same set of multi-band filters. In addition to the H$\alpha$ filter,
which is already vastly applied to systematically searching for H$\alpha$ emitters
the telescopes offer 11 more filters. And more ambitious yet the JPAS survey that
will the same area of J-PLUS in 56 narrow-band filters.

Traditionally, color-color diagrams based in H$\alpha$ filter are been used to
identify H$\alpha$ emitters.  The analysis the color-color diagram  (r - H$\alpha$)
versus (r - i) has resulted on the discoveried of new emission line objects, for
instance \citet{Witham:2006, Witham:2007}  used the (r - H$\alpha$) versus (r - i)
colour-colour diagram to find for new CV. On the other hand, \citet{Vink:2008} reported
the discovery of YSOs by using this same colour criteria. In this sense using
this methology a variety of classes of objects are been identified, which include
symbiotic stars \citep{Corradi:2008, Corradi:2010, Corradi:2011}, early type emission
line stars \citep{Drew:2008} and planetary nebulae \citep{Viirone:2009, Sabin:2010}.
Recently, by using this same color diagram were also identified compact PN candidates
in VPHAS+ catalog \citep{Akras:2019}. And the same diagram in conjunction with new
ones shows to be very efficient to find for PN candidates \citep{Gutierrez:2020}.
In general terms, \citet{Witham:2006} presented a methodology and first results
in looking for emission line sources in narrow-band surveys.     

In this work, we used S-PLUS observations of the southern hemisphere to search
for objects with an excess of H{$\alpha$} using automatic methods based on the
(r - H$\alpha$) versus (r - i) color-color diagram we also used color criteria
based in (g - r) and (z - g) in conjunction to unsupervised machine learning
techniques to split the final list in those with blue and red continuum. The
paper is organized as follows...

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:obser}

Particularly, we are implemented data from S-PLUS DR3 (ref) to carried out our
study. S-PLUS is 12-band optical photometric survey, which are formed by using
seven narrow-band and five brow-band like SDSS filters. The narrow-band set
include the filter $J$0660 which detect the H{$\alpha$} emission line.
Figure~\ref{fig:curves} shows the Javalambre filter system (Marín-Franch et al. 2012)
overlapping are the optical spectra of several class emission line objects on which
it is possible to see that the H{$\alpha$} line falls into the $J$0660 filter, except
for the QSOs.   

The actual data release contains about 60 millions of objects covering a total
area of $\sim$8000 deg$^2$, at high Galactic latitudes ($ > 30$~deg) using a
dedicated 0.83m robotic telescope,the T80-South (T80S), located at Cerro Tololo,
Chile. S-PLUS willcover an additional1300 deg2of the Galactic plane and bulge
toenable Galactic studies. In this work, we focus on the aspects thatare of
particular interest to the second data release of the S-PLUS main survey.
Additional information about S-PLUS can be found in \citet{Mendes:2019}.

      classes of emission line objects, from upper to down PN, SySt ... }
    \label{fig:curves}
\end{figure}


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:metho}

We first constructed a sub-sample from all S-PLUS DR3 from which we
applied an iterative and automatic technique to select objects with
an excess of H{$\alpha$} emission line,  as we describe below:

\subsection{Initial selection sample}
\label{sec:}

The firts step in our selection procedure consist in the following
criteria to guarantee the quality of the observations of the objects:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The sources must have detection in the filters: $r$, $i$ and
  $J$0660. To assure that we select object must have error minor or
  equal to 0.2 in each of three filter.

\item Must have an $r$ magnitude until $r = 21$.
  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding the main stellar locus and selecting the H{$\alpha$ emitters} }
\label{sec:}

Once the initial cut were made, we proceed to select the objects with
an excess of H{$\alpha$} wich is represent relatively high value of
the filter $J$0660 in comparison with r-band filter. For that we
first divided our sub-sample in for magnitude bins using the $r$-band
magnitudes. The bins have the follow distribution:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 bin- objects with magnitude in the $r$-band $r < 16$
\item 2 bin- objects with magnitude in the $r$-band $16 \leq r < 18$
\item 3 bin- objects with magnitude in the $r$-band $18 \leq r < 20$
\item 4 bin- objects with magnitude in the $r$-band $20 \leq r < 21$
  
\end{itemize}

To select t sn
\citet{Witham:2008} presented a catalogue of point-sources H{$\alpha$}
emission objects identified in IPHAS. 

To select the emission lines we used the same method created and
implemented by \citet{Witham:2008} its possible to do that because
the S-PLUS has similar filters that the IPHAS project, which are
$r$, $J$0660 and $i$. This technique was used by \citet{Scaringi:2013}
to identify blue objects with excess of H{$\alpha$} and after that
\citet{Wevers:2017} also applied this methodology to create catalogue
of candidate H{$\alpha$} emission showing a high effectiveness.    
Applying the selection criteria to selecting H$\alpha$ emitters.
We used the same procedure in  \citet{Wevers:2017}. The objects
with H$\alpha$ excess meet the condition:


\begin{equation}
  (r - J0660)_{\mathrm{obs}} - (r - J0660)_{\mathrm{fit}} \geq C \times \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mathrm{s}} - \sigma^2_{\mathrm{phot}}}
\end{equation}
 
 
where $\sigma_s$ is the root mean squared value of the residuals around
the fit and $\sigma_{phot}$ is the error on the observed $(r - J0660)$ colour

First see an approximation of the  4$\sigma$ cut away from the ariginal fit.
Figure~\ref{fig:criteria-color-plot} shows the procedure implemented
to select the H{$\alpha$} emitters in all S-PLUS DR3

    colour-colour plots. The thin red lines illustrate the original least-squares
    fit to all the data (grey points). The thin blue lines represent the final
    fits to the upper locus of points obtained by applying an iterative
    σ -clipping technique to the initial fit. The actual cuts used to select H{$\alpha$}
    emitters are shown by the thick dashed lines. If the cut was based on the initial (final)
    fit, it is shown in red (blue). Objects selected as Hα emitters must be located above
    the cut and are shown as large triangles. Note that the cut lines shown here
    are only approximate, as the actual selection criterion also considers the errors on
    each individual data point. This explains, for example, why an object in the bottom
    right-hand panel is not selected despite clearly lying above the cut line.}

\subsection{Clustering techniques}
\label{sec:clustering}

In this work we are using unsupervised machine learning approaches to divided our sample
in two groups: one represent the blue sources and the another one are the red sources. The blue
are those that have strong emission of the continuum on the part blue of the spectrum and
the another with strong emission continuum of the red one. 

\subsubsection{Hierarchical clustering}
\label{sec:Hierar}

Hierarchical clustering also known as hierarchical cluster analysis ({\sc hca}),
is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters.
The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each
other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

Choosing the number of cluster. Firstly, the Hierarchical cluster output dendrogram (tree)
can be implemented to obtain the desired clustering. Secondly, the dendrogram schema  allows
a convenient way to establish the entity relationship between at all levels of granularity.
In conclusion, a dendrogram is a visualization in form of a tree showing the order
and distances of merges during the hierarchical clustering.

\begin{itemize}
  
     \item On the x axis you see labels. If you don't specify anything else they
       are the indices of your samples in X.
     \item On the y axis you see the distances (of the 'ward' method in our case).
       
\end{itemize}


\subsubsubsection{Dendrogram Truncation}

As you might have noticed, the above is pretty big for many samples already and you
probably have way more in real scenarios, so let me spend a few seconds on highlighting
some other features of the dendrogram() function:


Starting from each label at the bottom, you can see a vertical line up to a
horizontal line. The height of that horizontal line tells you about the distance
at which this label was merged into another label or cluster. You can find that
other cluster by following the other vertical line down again. If you don't
encounter another horizontal line, it was just merged with the other label
you reach, otherwise it was merged into another cluster that was formed earlier.

Hierarchical clustering can be performed with either a distance matrix or raw data.
When raw data is provided, the software will automatically compute a distance
matrix in the background. The distance matrix below shows the distance between
six objects.

Hierarchical clustering starts by treating each observation as a separate cluster.
Then, it repeatedly executes the following two steps: (1) identify the two
clusters that are closest together, and (2) merge the two most similar clusters.
This iterative process continues until all the clusters are merged together.
This is illustrated in the diagrams below.

Hierarchical clustering 2

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Simbad}

We made cross-match between our sample and Simbad. We found 1000
matches that include a big variety of emission line objects:

\subsubsection{Nebulae}

As was mentioned, objects with nebulousity include several
type of objects from H II region, planetary nebulae and galaxies.
The H II regions are objects with gas that being ionized by
O star on which are formed the emission lines. In this situation new
stars are formed. Unlike H II regions, planetary nebulae
represent the final stages of low- and intermediate-mass stars
where the gas previously ejected is ionized by their central star.
